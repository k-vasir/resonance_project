->the résonance project

  //résonance is a visual and sonic experience that captures the essence of human interaction through texture, tone, and gesture. Through the movement and touch of the hands, the user shapes sound in real time, transforming an FM synthesizer drenched in reverb into evolving waves of atmosphere. Each motion becomes part of the composition, dissolving the boundaries between performer and instrument. As visuals shift and respond with the sound, the user enters a dreamlike, illusionary state where body, signal, and space resonate as one
